## Introduction

This project aims to develop a chatbot using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to interact with users, providing meaningful responses based on the input it receives. The project utilizes various libraries and APIs to achieve its functionality.

## Features

- Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
- Contextual response generation
- Integration with external APIs for enhanced capabilities
- Customizable and extendable architecture

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnuragB2004/RAG-Based-LLM-Chatbot
   cd RAG-Based-LLM-Chatbot
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the `Chatbot-Main.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage

To use the chatbot, run all the cells in the Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains detailed comments and instructions on how to interact with the chatbot.
